# Dependencies
### Screenshots
As you may notice (or maybe not lol), I use my own script for screenshots, where I call whatever I need.  
This line is located in the **key bindings** section and looks like this:
```c
    /* Screenshots */
    { 0, XK_Print, spawn, SHCMD("~/configurations/scripts/make-screenshot.sh") }
```
You can do the same — just replace the script path with your own.
